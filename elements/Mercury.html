<h2 id="Mercury-information">Information</h2>
<p>Mercury (Hg), also known as quicksilver, is a <strong><em>unique</em></strong> metallic element, one of only two known elements that are in a liquid state at room temperature, along with Bromine (Br). Mercury, at room temperature, is a fast-moving, shiny but very poisonous substance to humans. The symbol (Hg) stands for hydrargyrum, originating from Greek, meaning "liquid silver”. Although very poisonous to humans, Mercury can still be very helpful because of its electromagnetic properties. For example, it could be used in switches in thermostats, coolant in nuclear power plants, and neon lights. Sometimes, when mercury was mined, it would surround gold like a shiny pellet, and it would have to be burned to obtain the purified gold. Mercury is rarely found in nature and is never found in its purest state, but as Mercury Sulfide (HgS).</p>

<h2 id="Mercury-History">History</h2>
<p>Mercury was discovered in the year 1500 B.C. and was used to treat skin diseases, even though it was poisonous, leading to countless deaths around 500 B.C.E. all over India and China. Studies have reported that Chinese women would use Mercury as a sedative in traditional Chinese medicine. In the 18th century, Mercury was increasingly used in scientific research equipment as a result of Torricelli's invention.</p>
