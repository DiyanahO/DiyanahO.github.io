Although very poisonous to humans, Mercury can still be very helpful because of its electro-magnetic properties for example: it could be used in switches in thermostats, coolant in nuclear power plants and neon light. sometimes, when mercury was mined is would surround gold like a shiny pellet would have to burn to get the purified gold. Mercury is rarely ever found in nature and is never found in its purest state, but as Mercury Sulfide(HgS)</p>
